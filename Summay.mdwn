# Unit 10â€”A Yen for the Future

## Time series Forecasting

In this section, we utilized three time series models, which are _ARMA_, _ARIMA_, and _GARCH_ to analyze and forecast the returns of Yen futures. 

### 1. ARMA model
For ARMA(2,1) model, the p-values for those coefficients are all large than 0.05 which means those variables do not have significant contribution to the output. In other word, ARMA model is not ideal for this time series data. 
In terms of prejection, the model prejects a downside return for next 5 days, as showed below.

### 2. ARIMA model
Though the AIC and BIC statistics are larger than those in ARMA model, the coefficients are still not significant since they are not less than 0.05(significance level).
Regarding the projected prices for the next 5 days, it seems that the prices go up slightly, as showed below.

### 3 GARCH model
The model indicates that there are some variables e.g. omega, alpha1 that have great impact on the final output. And the projected volatility will increase for next 5 days, as showed below.

**Questions**
1. Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now? 

Ans: I would not like to buy yen now. Beacuse the returns are relatively smaller and decreasing over the next few days. In addtion, the volatility is increasing for the next few days. In all, the sharpe ratio is decreasing which indicates a bad investment.

2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

Ans: As the volatility shows, the risk is increasing for the following days.

3. Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

Ans: I will not be confident using these models. One is that after ploting the ACF and PACF, the orders or parameters for these model are not valid. On the other hand, the variables selected for those model are not significant,leading to a inaccuarate projection or estimation.

## Regression analysis

**Question**
1. Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?

Ans: According to the Root Mean Squared, the model performs better on out-of-sample data.
